# Week 7

## Weekly Goals

1. Build a front-end app in Javascript
2. Work competently in Javascript
3. Reason about asynchronous behaviour in Javascript

#### Plans to achieve:

1. 
  - Go through [Notes SPA](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/tree/master/further_javascript) in either the challenge or project styles. 
  - Ask Tatsiana or EÃ³in about another small JS project I can potentially use in the mornings to test out my learning.
2. Begin the week by consolidating my current JS knowledge, listing the concepts I do know and those I want to work on.  
3. Revisit workshop notes on asynchronous JS. Apply this knowledge in the Notes app. 

#### Evidence:

1. 
  - A Notes app repo.
  &&/|| 
  - Another small JS project repo - potentially something that I can build on.
2. A list of current competencies, and those I need to work on - evidence that I have moved *some* items from the latter to the former. 
3. 
  - A Notes app repo.
  &&/||
  - Another small JS project repo - ask for a code review on this. 

## Daily Goals

#### Monday 30th September
- GOAL: To assess my current JS knowledge.
- PLAN: Make a two-column list of what I do know, and what I need to learn. 
- EVIDENCE: I've done the columns and have started working on transferring stuff over to the **What I Know** column from the **What I Don't Know Yet** columns. I looked at some ES6 class syntax and did a code snippet from one of the practicals. 
- FEEDBACK: 
  - SELF-ASSESSMENT: I feel a lot more confident in my JavaScript ability right now - there are things I know, and I can work on improving that knowledge over this week. 

#### Tuesday 1st October
- GOAL: To remember and understand the Ajax Request/Response cycle.
- PLAN: Look over my notes from last week's practical, and research other intro guides. Create a code snippet in my JS folder.
