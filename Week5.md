# Week 5

## Weekly Goals

1. Test drive a simple front-end web app with Javascript
2. Follow an effective process for learning a new language


#### Plans to achieve:

1. Work through thermostat challenge, creating a web-app.
2. Read up on learning new languages and make notes on how to do this for future learning attempts. 

#### Evidence:

1. A repo for the thermostat challenge. 
2. A set of notes and ideas on how to go about learning a language. 

## Daily Goals

#### Monday 16th September
- GOAL: To remember some strategies for learning an new language. 
- PLAN: Firstly, I'm going to read [this article](https://hackmd.io/kMNgXiPHQf2Q_P9A-tnS9A) on learning a new language. Then I'm going to work through the JavaScript explainers in the [Technical Learning Resources](https://airtable.com/shrbaXgV5mQnsvuGe/tblokmw6yNUO75ge6) for this week.
- EVIDENCE: A set of notes on strategies for learning a new language, and some direction for the future as to what strategies work best for me based on my learning style. 
- FEEDBACK:
  - SELF-ASSESSMENT: So, on reflection, there's no danger that by the end of today I was going to have a full set of notes on how to learn a new language; what I do have is a start. I read the aforementioned article and began to create [my Ruby/JavaScript dictionary](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YT-5ZpmonaLAH1DrkNIYzpgv_rhpxbF3/view?usp=sharing), and I've learnt a few that should help me to get on with coding in JavaScript this week. However, I'm worried about only seeing similarity, and not comparing for contrast, the danger being that I won't appreciate the fundamental difference of JavaScript (of which I'm aware generally, if not specifically), and thus won't understand when the gaseous bubbles of quirk rise from the deep-sea trench of difference. I'll keep going with the dictionary, but tomorrow I'd also like to have a loook at articles that explain the fundamental difference in how the language is structured.
  
#### Tuesday 17th September
- GOAL: To continue to learn strategies to learn a new language, particularly investigating the difference between Ruby and JavaScript.
- PLAN: Research the fundamental difference between the two languages. Continue filling out the Ruby/JavaScript dictionary. 
- EVIDENCE: A more completed dictionary. Some notes on the structural difference between Ruby and JavaScript as languages.

#### Wednesday 18th September
- GOAL:  To learn about functionas and arrays in JavaScript. 
- PLAN: Read this article on [functions](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/pills/js_functions.md) and this one on [arrays](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/pills/js_arrays.md). 
- EVIDENCE: Notes on both topics.
