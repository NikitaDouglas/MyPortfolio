# Week 5

## Weekly Goals

1. Test drive a simple front-end web app with Javascript
2. Follow an effective process for learning a new language


#### Plans to achieve:

1. Work through thermostat challenge, creating a web-app.
2. Read up on learning new languages and make notes on how to do this for future learning attempts. 

#### Evidence:

1. A repo for the thermostat challenge. 
2. A set of notes and ideas on how to go about learning a language. 

## Daily Goals

#### Monday 16th September
- GOAL: To remember some strategies for learning an new language. 
- PLAN: Firstly, I'm going to read [this article](https://hackmd.io/kMNgXiPHQf2Q_P9A-tnS9A) on learning a new language. Then I'm going to work through the JavaScript explainers in the [Technical Learning Resources](https://airtable.com/shrbaXgV5mQnsvuGe/tblokmw6yNUO75ge6) for this week.
- EVIDENCE: A set of notes on strategies for learning a new language, and some direction for the future as to what strategies work best for me based on my learning style. 
- FEEDBACK:
  - SELF-ASSESSMENT: So, on reflection, there's no danger that by the end of today I was going to have a full set of notes on how to learn a new language; what I do have is a start. I read the aforementioned article and began to create [my Ruby/JavaScript dictionary](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YT-5ZpmonaLAH1DrkNIYzpgv_rhpxbF3/view?usp=sharing), and I've learnt a few that should help me to get on with coding in JavaScript this week. However, I'm worried about only seeing similarity, and not comparing for contrast, the danger being that I won't appreciate the fundamental difference of JavaScript (of which I'm aware generally, if not specifically), and thus won't understand when the gaseous bubbles of quirk rise from the deep-sea trench of difference. I'll keep going with the dictionary, but tomorrow I'd also like to have a loook at articles that explain the fundamental difference in how the language is structured.
  
#### Tuesday 17th September
- GOAL: To continue to learn strategies to learn a new language, particularly investigating the difference between Ruby and JavaScript.
- PLAN: Research the fundamental difference between the two languages. Continue filling out the Ruby/JavaScript dictionary. 
- EVIDENCE: A more completed dictionary. Some notes on the structural difference between Ruby and JavaScript as languages.
- FEEDBACK:
  - SELF-ASSESSMENT: The workshop on the constructor/protoype pattern was really useful this morning, but it went on for longer than was set and I wasn't able to read any of the aritcles that I wanted to read. Tomorrow, I will specify a couple of articles that I really want to get though and will prioritise those. The workshop was useful and I was able to use the pattern in the afternoon challenge.
  - COACH: I also got some feedback from Katerina on the work I did in the workshop yesterday. I'd suitably demonstrated the constructor/protoype pattern, but probably could have thought through my objects/messages table in porder that the correct objects were responsible for the correct outcomes. 

#### Wednesday 18th September
- GOAL:  To learn about functionas and arrays in JavaScript. 
- PLAN: Read this article on [functions](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/pills/js_functions.md) and this one on [arrays](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/pills/js_arrays.md). 
- EVIDENCE: Notes on both topics.
- FEEDBACK:
  - SELF-ASSESSMENT: Thankfully the workshop ran to time this morning so I was able to get on with making these notes, and I managed to explore the "this" keyword, the concept of falsy in Javascript, and the ES6 classes syntax. I feel like I am getting to grips with Javascript, though I'm not sure how much I've been paying attention to the skill of learning a new language, so I'll try and make notes on that tomorrow. 

#### Thursday 19th September
- GOAL: 
- To explore the AJAX request/response cycle and the function of callbacks. 
- To understand closures in Javascript.
- PLAN: Begin with the [closures practical](https://hackmd.io/cIFsMAqISHqVHN_-p9hY0Q), and do further research as necessary.
- EVIDENCE: Make notes on closures.
- FEEDBACK:
- **AJAX and Callbacks*
  - SELF-ASSESSMENT: I paired with Rachael over the practical workshop on [AJAX](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/tree/master/week-5/callbacks_following_the_flow_of_control) [callbacks](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/tree/master/week-5/callbacks_following_the_flow_of_control). I feel like I can define what AJAX is and where it is used, but I'm still not entirely clear on the definition/function of callbacks - I'll try and crystalize this tomorrow when I look at the event loop.
- **CLOSURES**
  - SELF-ASSESSMENT: This was a really tricky topic; I can explain what a closure is but I'm not sure I could consciously apply that knowledge and use it in context. 

#### Friday 20th September
- GOAL: 
  - To understand the event loop and asynchronicity in Javascript.  
  - To compile a list of notes to help me learn another language in future. 
- PLAN: Watch the video on [asynchronicity and the event loop](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/blob/master/week-5/async_JS.md).
- EVIDENCE:
  - Notes on the event loop and asynchronicity. 
  - Notes on learning languages. 

## Reflection

### Question 1

*Did you meet all of your goals to the standard you set at the start of the week?*


### Question 2

*What would you change/improve moving forward?*
