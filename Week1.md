# Week 1

## Weekly Goals
1. Test-drive a simple program using objects and methods.<br/>
2. Pair using the driver-navigator style.<br/> 
3. Follow an effective debugging process.<br/> 
4. Describe some basic OO principles like encapsulation, SRP. 

#### Plans to achieve:
1. Work through Boris Bike challenge, attend workshop, and use Tuesday/Wednesday morning to go through 2 TDD exercises from [Practicals](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/tree/master/practicals) and other resources.<br/>
2. Use the driver-navigator style in Boris Bikes challenge.<br/>
3. Attend debugging workshop and use Thursday morning to do [Debugging Approaches](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/blob/master/practicals/debugging/debugging_approaches.md).<br/>
4. On Friday, work through [Encapsulation & Cohesion](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/blob/master/practicals/object_oriented_design/encapsulation.md) and read through Wikipedia article on [Encapsulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_%28computer_programming%29).

## Daily Goals

#### Tuesday 20th August
- GOAL: To improve my ability to apply the principles of TDD.
- PLAN: Use Tuesday and Wednesday to complete [Test Driving I](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/blob/master/practicals/test_driving.md).
- EVIDENCE: [Test Driving I repo](https://github.com/NikitaDouglas/test_driving_1).

#### Wednesday 21st August
- GOAL: Continue to improve my ability to Test Drive a simple Ruby program; research how to progress through test creation and how to answer the question “What test do I create next?”
- PLAN: Use morning to complete [Test Driving I](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/blob/master/practicals/test_driving.md), and make a start on [Birthdays](https://github.com/makersacademy/birthdays).
- EVIDENCE: Completed [Test Driving I](https://github.com/NikitaDouglas/test_driving_1), and made a start on Birthdays, creating first three tests; I created the tests before creating any production code. I also moved from feature tests to unit tests in yhe Boris Bikes Challenge, and wrote my first unit test for that with my pair partner, using RSpec one-liner syntax. 
- FEEDBACK: 
  - Eóin's comment about not needing to know every RSpec matcher was really useful, so I googled for the kind of words I thought I'd need, and used the RSpec documentation.
  - I didn't get as far through Birthdays as I wanted to and I am worried about how this will impact my goals to get through other exercises this week. I may forego the debugging challenges tomorrow and focus on completing Birthdays instead.
  - It may be worth ensuring I make notes on all the necessary topics for a week and then concentrate on doing exercises for those things I find most difficult (or think I will); if I'm wrong, I can always go back and do exercises to support my study in a topic I find difficult. 
  
#### Thursday 22nd August
- GOAL: To be able to describe some basic OO principles. 
- PLAN: To research encapsulation and and other OO principles. Use Wikipedia and Google to find useful articles on these principles. I'd like to be able to have working definitions for these principles by lunchtime. 
- EVIDENCE: Explain the concepts I have researched to someone else to see if I understand them well enough to explain in a simple logical way.  

#### Friday 23rd August
- GOAL:
- PLAN:
- EVIDENCE:
  
## Reflection


### Question 1

*Did you meet all of your goals to the standard you set at the start of the week?*


### Question 2

*What would you change/improve moving forward?*
