# Week 1

## Weekly Goals
1. Test-drive a simple program using objects and methods.<br/>
2. Pair using the driver-navigator style.<br/> 
3. Follow an effective debugging process.<br/> 
4. Describe some basic OO principles like encapsulation, SRP. 

#### Plans to achieve:
1. Work through Boris Bike challenge, attend the workshop, and use Tuesday/Wednesday morning to go through 2 TDD exercises from [Practicals](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/tree/master/practicals) and other resources.<br/>
2. Use the driver-navigator style in Boris Bikes challenge.<br/>
3. Attend debugging workshop and use Thursday morning to do [Debugging Approaches](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/blob/master/practicals/debugging/debugging_approaches.md).<br/>
4. On Friday, work through [Encapsulation & Cohesion](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/blob/master/practicals/object_oriented_design/encapsulation.md) and read through Wikipedia article on [Encapsulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_%28computer_programming%29).

#### Evidence:
1. 
- Attended workshop on TDD and paired over a dice_app.
- Worked on the Boris Bikes challenge this week with a different pair each afternoon. My repo is [here](https://github.com/NikitaDouglas/boris_bikes), and [here] is a video of myself as the driver in a pair.
- Worked through two TDD exercises - [Test Driving I](https://github.com/NikitaDouglas/test_driving_1) and [Birthdays](https://github.com/NikitaDouglas/birthdays).
2.
- Paired during the Boris Bikes challenge, with four different pairing partners. I received positive and constructive feedback from them, and from Katarina who reviewed the screen recording of Rachael and my pairing session. In order this week:
  - Collaborated on [Josh's repository](https://github.com/joshuaabrookuk/Boris_Bikes).
  - Collaborated on [Emmanuel's repository](https://github.com/Emanuele-20/boris_bike_test).
  - [Co-authored commits](https://github.com/NikitaDouglas/boris_bikes/commit/7d75601e5210055cc74ffa8683cad5053d594232) on my repository with Rachael. 
  - Anthony collaborated on [my repository](https://github.com/NikitaDouglas/boris_bikes/graphs/contributors). 
3. Attended Debugging Workshop, but did not manage to complete any exercises. However, I did get practice at following the stack trace and googling for errors during the Boris Bikes challenge. 
4. Researched OOP principles and explained the concepts to my team.


## Daily Goals

#### Tuesday 12th May
- GOAL: To improve my ability to apply the principles of TDD.
- PLAN: Use Tuesday and Wednesday to complete [Test Driving I](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/blob/master/practicals/test_driving.md).
- EVIDENCE: [Test Driving I repo](https://github.com/NikitaDouglas/test_driving_1).

#### Wednesday 13th May
- GOAL: Continue to improve my ability to Test Drive a simple Ruby program; research how to progress through test creation and how to answer the question “What test do I create next?”
- PLAN: Use the morning to complete [Test Driving I](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/blob/master/practicals/test_driving.md), and make a start on [Birthdays](https://github.com/makersacademy/birthdays).
- EVIDENCE: Completed [Test Driving I](https://github.com/NikitaDouglas/test_driving_1), and made a start on Birthdays, creating the first three tests; I created the tests before creating any production code. I also moved from feature tests to unit tests in the Boris Bikes Challenge, and wrote my first unit test for that with my pair partner, using RSpec one-liner syntax. 
- FEEDBACK: 
  - SELF-ASSESSMENT: I didn't get as far through Birthdays as I wanted to and I am worried about how this will impact my goals to get through other exercises this week. I may forego the debugging challenges tomorrow and focus on completing Birthdays instead.
  - It may be worth ensuring I make notes on all the necessary topics for a week and then concentrate on doing exercises for those things I find most difficult (or think I will); if I'm wrong, I can always go back and do exercises to support my study in a topic I find difficult.  
  - COACH: Eóin's comment about not needing to know every RSpec matcher was useful, so I googled for the kind of words I thought I'd need, and used the RSpec documentation on Relish. 
  
  
#### Thursday 14th May
- GOAL: To be able to describe some basic OO principles. 
- PLAN: To research encapsulation and other OO principles. Use Wikipedia and Google to find useful articles on these principles. I'd like to be able to have working definitions for these principles by lunchtime. 
- EVIDENCE: Explain the concepts I have researched to someone else to see if I understand them well enough to explain in a simple logical way.
- FEEDBACK: 
  - SELF-ASSESSMENT: I feel confident in my ability to explain these principles. 
  - PEER GROUP: I explained the OOP concepts of encapsulation, cohesion, coupling, and SRP and got great feedback from my peer group; they said that they could understand my definitions and examples and that my explanation solidified their understanding of the concepts. 

#### Friday 15th May
- GOAL: Improve my application of TDD, especially my ability to write a test that actually tests the output I want.
- PLAN: Continue working on the Birthday exercise.
- EVIDENCE: Share my repo with my peer group and ask for feedback. This is the repo: [Birthdays](https://github.com/NikitaDouglas/birthdays). 
FEEDBACK:
  - SELF-ASSESSMENT: The challenge is incomplete but I wrote most of the necessary tests. The only bits I didn't manage to do were related to Time and the Timecop gem.
  - PEER GROUP: I had approached the challenge in a similar way to my peer group, and although I hadn't got quite as far with the challenge as two of the group, I had stuck to strict TDD to build this skill. 
  - I got some great feedback on refactoring my tests to describe not only the class but the methods too, which I implemented in the morning to improve readability, and finished the refactor with everything green. 
  - COACH: Katarina mentioned in a separate chat that the `expect(some_class_instance).to respond_to(:some_method)` is mostly only useful when beginning with RSpec, so I refactored my tests to remove these examples.  
  
## Reflection


### Question 1

*Did you meet all of your goals to the standard you set at the start of the week?*

Breakdown of goals:

1. Test-drive a simple program using objects and methods.<br/>
I think I achieved this goal. I used the TDD Driving I and Birthdays exercises further to understand how to do TDD, and saw my ability to build a test-driven program improve as the week went on. I did not complete the Birthdays exercise but did complete the TDD aspects of the challenge, if not the features using Timecop and the Time class. I learned about RSpec matchers and different kinds of RSpec syntax which I will try to utilise by refactoring tests in the future. 

2. Pair using the driver-navigator style.<br/> 
I have done a lot of pairing this week during the Boris Bike challenge and feel confident in my ability to pair. I received great feedback both from my pair partners and from the coach who reviewed my video. 

3. Follow an effective debugging process.<br/>
I can follow a debugging process and have utilised it during my self-led learning time and pairing sessions. 

4. Describe some basic OOP principles like encapsulation, SR
I am confident in my ability to describe these principles and explain them to others.

### Question 2

*What would you change/improve moving forward?*

- I'd like to improve my confidence as a driver by writing more code during my pairing sessions, rather than hanging back and pontificating.
- I think I need to stick to the process more keenly when I encounter bugs, rather than allowing it to be so 'slapdash'. I especially need to utilise the 'p' or '.inspect' methods more frequently. 
- I'd like to be able to apply OOP principles when I am creating programs.
