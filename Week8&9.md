# Weeks 8/9

## Weekly Goals

1. Can you use high-quality processes to build a project in a team?
  - [Project Criteria](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/final_projects/project_criteria.md) must be met.
  - Record things that we learn 
2. Learn how to use Heroku. 
3. Learn how to use Rails. 

#### Plans to achieve:

1. Strictly follow project criteria. Continue to focus on process/TDD/understanding over completion.

2. Spend Tuesday morning researching and attempting to deploy app via Heroku. 
3. Spend time this week working out how to use Rails. 

#### Evidence:

1. Trello, linked to Github issues and merge requests, as well as Travis CI or alternative setup to protect Master branch. 
2. Have deployed our app with Heroku - write a wiki page on this.
3. Write a wiki using Rails.
