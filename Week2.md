# Week 2

## Weekly Goals

1. Use all of week 1's skills (don't underestimate the importance of this)
2. Break one class into two classes that work together, while maintaining test coverage
3. Unit test classes in isolation using mocking
  - Mocking exercise. 
  - Dependency injection exercise. 
4. Explain some basic OO principles and tie them to high level concerns (e.g. ease of change)
  - Exercise to test application of OOP principles.
  - Research forwarding and polymorphism.
5. Review another person's code and give them meaningful feedback

#### Plans to achieve:

1. Continue using strict TDD process. Consolidate exisiting knowkedge of OOP principles by doing the [OOP_1](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/tree/master/week-1/oop_1) exercise on encapsulation on Monday. Continue to request feedback for pairing, improving each day. Ensure I follow an effective Debugging process when I encounter bugs. 
2. 
3. Further explore mocking by beginning [Mocking_1](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/tree/master/week-1/mocking_1) exercise on Wednesday and Thursday morning. On Friday morning, explore [Dependency Injection](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/blob/master/practicals/object_oriented_design/dependency_injection.md).
4. Use Monday to do OOP_1 (see above). On Tuesday, research forwarding and polymorphism, and look at cocepts in [OOP_2](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/tree/master/week-2/oop_2) and [OOP_3](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/tree/master/week-2/oop_3). 
5. Code review on Monday?

## Daily Goals

#### Monday 18th May
- GOAL: 
  - To apply my knowledge of OOP principles. 
  - Get feedback on goal setting.
- PLAN: Begin the exercises in [OOP_1](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/tree/master/week-1/oop_1).
- EVIDENCE: 
  - I completed the exercise in OOP_1, and will ask for feedback on the code snippet from a coach.
  - Send Week1.md to Eóin to ask for feedback.
- FEEBACK:
- **OOP Principles**
  - SELF-ASSESSMENT: I followed along with the video attached to the OOP_1 skills workshop, and then when the video ended prematurely, I went ahead and did the encapsulation exercise, seperating the methods into two classes, as well as creating a private method in the Calculator class. I feel I understood the principle of encapsulation that the exercise aimed to teach, and I was able to apply that principle.
  - COACH:
- **Goal Setting**
  - SELF-ASSESSMENT: I’ve found the process really helpful - I’ve found my goals to be realistic, though I have had to lower my expectations about what I can reasonably ‘finish’ in a week. On Week 1 my plan for the week did change, and I got a little bit worried about changing my focus - I had to relinquish my aim to do Debugging exercises as it took my longer than planned to do Birthdays, and I was worried that I wouldn’t be able to achieve the goal. But I can rest safe in the knowledge that I'll be using debugging frequently!
