# Week 2

## Weekly Goals

1. Use all of week 1's skills (don't underestimate the importance of this)
2. Break one class into two classes that work together, while maintaining test coverage
3. Unit test classes in isolation using mocking
  - Mocking exercise. 
  - Dependency injection exercise. 
4. Explain some basic OO principles and tie them to high level concerns (e.g. ease of change)
  - Exercise to test application of OOP principles.
  - Research forwarding and polymorphism.
5. Review another person's code and give them meaningful feedback

#### Plans to achieve:

1. Continue using strict TDD process. Consolidate exisiting knowkedge of OOP principles by doing the [OOP_1](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/tree/master/week-1/oop_1) exercise on encapsulation on Monday. Continue to request feedback for pairing, improving each day. Ensure I follow an effective Debugging process when I encounter bugs. 
2. 
3. Further explore mocking by beginning [Mocking_1](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/tree/master/week-1/mocking_1) exercise on Wednesday and Thursday morning. On Friday morning, explore [Dependency Injection](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/blob/master/practicals/object_oriented_design/dependency_injection.md).
4. Use Monday to do OOP_1 (see above). On Tuesday, research forwarding and polymorphism, and look at cocepts in [OOP_2](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/tree/master/week-2/oop_2) and [OOP_3](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/tree/master/week-2/oop_3). 
5. Code review on Monday?
