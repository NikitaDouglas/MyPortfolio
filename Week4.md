# Week 4

## Weekly Goals

1. Build a simple web app with a database
2. Follow an effective debugging process for database applications
3. Explain the basics of how databases work (e.g. tables, SQL, basic relationships)
4. Goals carried over from last week:
  - Follow an effective debugging process for web applications.
  - Explain the MVC pattern
  - Explain what Rack is.
5. Explain the difference between Class and Instance variables and methods, and explain when to use them with reference to web apps. 

#### Plans to achieve:

1.
- Build Bookmark Manager in the afternoons. 
- Build Chitter App this weekend.

2.
- Work through [Debugging 2](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/tree/master/week-3/debugging_2) as I was unable to do so last week.
- Look through [REST game](https://github.com/sjmog/rest) with Sam on Thursday evening. 
3.
- On Monday and Tuesday morning, work through [SQLZoo](https://sqlzoo.net/). 
- Use Tuesday lunchtime to read through the [Illustrated Guide to Databases](https://illustrated.dev/databases).
- Use Wednesday lunchtime, research [Entity Relationship Diagrams](https://hackmd.io/ICgoC6o8QJOdosAKJ6fhhw).
- Use the evenings this week to remind myself of SQL on SoloLearn. 
4. 
- Debugging - See Plan #2
- MVC Pattern - Research and make notes on the MVC pattern, specific to Ruby on Tuesday morning. Begin with [this article](https://medium.com/@sumunchies/general-overview-of-building-a-basic-sinatra-application-using-the-mvc-pattern-ee8f4811c065).
- Rack - Read and make notes on [this article](https://thoughtbot.com/upcase/videos/rack) on Thursday morning.
5. Also on Tuesday morning, research the difference and uses of class and instance variables and methods. For variables, see [this article](http://www.railstips.org/blog/archives/2006/11/18/class-and-instance-variables-in-ruby/), and methods see [this one](http://www.railstips.org/blog/archives/2009/05/11/class-and-instance-methods-in-ruby/). Consider asking a coach for an overview.

## Daily Goals

#### Monday 9th September
- GOAL: To understand the basics of SQL and databases.
- PLAN: Begin to work through [SQLZoo](https://sqlzoo.net/).
- EVIDENCE: A working knowledge of some SQL in order that I can query databases.
- FEEDBACK: 
  - SELF-ASSESSMENT: I've worked with SQL before so the language isn't entirely alien to me. I feel that I made good progress with SQLZoo. I feel like I'fd benefit from a refresher as to how this works in practice, so I'll use Tuesday lunctime to read over the illustrated guid to databases. 

#### Tuesday 10th September
- GOAL: To further understand the basics of SQL. 
- PLAN: Continue working through [SQLZoo](https://sqlzoo.net/).
- EVIDENCE: A working knowledge of some SQL in order that I can query databases. I should be able to use this knowledge in the afternoon challenge and in other projects I attack this week.  
- FEEDBACK:
  - SELF-ASSESSMENT: I actually relinquished working through SQLZoo as some of the functionality on the website wasn't working. I worked through the [Learn SQL](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-sql) tutorial on Codecademy and found it reall useful. 

#### Wednesday 11th September
- GOAL: To understand what an Entity Relationship Diagram is, its purpose, and how to build one.
- PLAN: Research and make notes using the [Entity Relationship Diagrams](https://hackmd.io/ICgoC6o8QJOdosAKJ6fhhw).[Entity Relationship Diagrams](https://hackmd.io/ICgoC6o8QJOdosAKJ6fhhw) article as a starting point. 
- EVIDENCE: Use this technique when building my Diary App tomoorow and get feedback from a coach on the diagram. 
- FEEDBACK: 
  - SELF-ASSESSMENT: I didn't get around to doing this today due to personal stuff going on - I'm going to replace my Friday with working on these things. 

#### Friday 13th September
- GOAL: To understand REST patterns in MVC model, Rack, and Entity Relationship Diagrams.
- PLAN: Use the resources listed above to explore these three concepts. 
- EVIDENCE: I want to be able to identify these patterns, and perhaps use an Entity Relationship Diagram in the afternoon challenge this weekend. I will ask for some coach feedback on my afternoon challenge with particular focus on these concepts. 

## Reflection

### Question 1

*Did you meet all of your goals to the standard you set at the start of the week?*


### Question 2

*What would you change/improve moving forward?*
