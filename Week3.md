# Week 3

## Weekly Goals

1. Build a simple web app
2. Follow an effective debugging process for web applications
3. Explain the basics of how the web works (e.g. request/response, HTTP, HTML, CSS)
4. Explain the MVC pattern

#### Plans to achieve:

1. 
- Work through the afternoon challenge [Battles](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/tree/master/intro_to_the_web).
- Use Thursday and Friday morning to work through the [Birthday Greeter app](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/intro_to_the_web/post_challenges/birthday_app.md).
2. 
- Use Wednesday morning after the workshop to explore [Dubugging 2](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/tree/master/week-3/debugging_2).
3.
- Research internet and web acronyms, structure, and protocols on Monday after Code Review. Make notes. 
- Look at [How DNS Works comic](https://howdns.works/) on Tuesday lunchtime. Make notes. 
- Use Wednesday Lunctime to research and understand [Rack](https://thoughtbot.com/upcase/videos/rack).
4. 
- Research the MVC pattern on Thursday evening. 

#### Evidence:

1.
- Progress made in the afternoon challenge, Battles. 
- A repository for my Birthday Greeter app that I can ask for feedback on. 
2. 
- Create a step-by-step approach for debugging web apps that I can stick on my monitor. 
- Apply this knowledge in Battles and Birthday Greeter. 
- Potentially revisit Takeaway and apply knowledge from this exercise to understand why I wasn't able to send orders by text message. 
3.
- Have made notes on the as yet unfamiliar words, concepts, and acronyms in this topic. 
- Be able to test out this knowledge in the Battles and Birthday Greeter exercises. I want to be able to see/read a word and recognise it and the concept that it represents. 
4. 


## Daily Goals

#### Tuesday 26th May
- GOAL: To be able to explain the request/response cycle, understand the structure of the Internet and the Web, and know what all these acronyms stand for!
- PLAN: Research these words and concepts, using [this](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/93dba358ffb235d943c5f13349f6a26e5487d17b/pills/internet_web.md) article as a starting point. 
- EVIDENCE: Be able to work through the afternoon challenge, understanding what I'm doing and brining my research into focus. 
- FEEDBACk: 
- SELF-ASSESSMENT: I felt like I really got to grips with this topic today; this afternoon I was able to identify the client and server in the request/response cycle, as well as understand the acronyms that proliferate this topic, which helps me to understand what's going on in long-form. 

#### Wednesday 27th May
- GOAL: To understand how to Debug web applications as opposed to standard applications. 
- PLAN: Work through [Dubugging 2](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/tree/master/week-3/debugging_2).
- EVIDENCE: I should be able to apply this knowledge to our afternoon challenge and the Birthday app I will embark on tomorrow. Also, I want to create a step-by-step approach for debugging web apps that I can stick on my monitor. 
- FEEDBACk: N/A


## Reflection

### Question 1

*Did you meet all of your goals to the standard you set at the start of the week?*

Unfortunately, I don't feel like I did meet my goals this week. I was unwell towards the end of the week, hence the missing goals for Thursday and Friday, and this affected my ability to complete the goals in the manner I had planned. I did get quite far through the battles exercise, and feel confident in my ability to replicate the setup and process of building a web app in the weekend challenge. I do feel that my knowledge of 'how the internet works' is vastly improved, and I understand the process of what's going on far better than I did at the beginning of the week. 

However, I did not manage to follow a debugging process specific to web apps, as I did not complete Debugging 2, and I am not yet able to explain the MVC pattern.


### Question 2

*What would you change/improve moving forward?*

Moving forward, I'd like to improve my ability to build a simple web app in this weekend's challenge. Moreover, I'd like to spend time next week going over the Debugging 2 exercise and researching and understanding the MVC pattern.
